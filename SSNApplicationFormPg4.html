    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">Protect your SSN card and number from loss and identity theft. DO NOT carry your SSN card with you.
        Keep it in a secure location and only take it with you when you must show the card; e.g., to obtain a new
        job, open a new bank account, or to obtain benefits from certain U.S. agencies. Use caution in giving
        out your Social Security number to others, particularly during phone, mail, email and Internet requests
        you did not initiate.</p>

    <center><h2 style="color: #002A5C;">Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2></center>

    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">Sections 205(c) and 702 of the Social Security Act, as amended, authorize us to collect this
        information. The information you provide will be used to assign you a Social Security number and
        issue a Social Security card.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">The information you furnish on this form is voluntary. However, failure to provide the requested
        information may prevent us from issuing you a Social Security number and card.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">We rarely use the information you supply for any purpose other than for issuing a Social Security
        number and card. However, we may use it for the administration and integrity of Social Security
        programs. We may also disclose information to another person or to another agency in accordance
        with approved routine uses, which include but are not limited to the following:
    <ol style=" color: #002A5C;">
    <li>To enable a third party or an agency to assist Social Security in establishing rights to
        Social Security benefits and/or coverage;</li>
    <li>To comply with Federal laws requiring the release of information from Social Security
        records (e.g., to the Government Accountability Office and Department of Veterans'
        Affairs);</li>
    <li>To make determinations for eligibility in similar health and income maintenance
        programs at the Federal, State, and local level; and</li>
    <li>To facilitate statistical research, audit or investigative activities necessary to assure the
        integrity of Social Security programs.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">We may also use the information you provide in computer matching programs. Matching programs
        compare our records with records kept by other Federal, State, or local government agencies.
        Information from these matching programs can be used to establish or verify a person's eligibility
        for Federally-funded or administered benefit programs and for repayment of payments or
        delinquent debts under these programs.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">Complete lists of routine uses for this information are available in System of Records Notice
        60-0058 (Master Files of Social Security Number (SSN) Holders and SSN Applications). The
        Notice, additional information regarding this form, and information regarding our systems and
        programs, are available on-line at <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov" style="color: #002A5C;" ><b>www.socialsecurity.gov </b></a> or at any local Social Security office.</p>

    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">This information collection meets the requirements of 44 U.S.C. §3507, as amended by Section 2 of the
        <u>Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</u>. You do not need to answer these questions unless we display a valid
        Office of Management and Budget control number. We estimate that it will take about 8.5 to 9.5 minutes
        to read the instructions, gather the facts, and answer the questions. You may send comments on our
        time estimate to: SSA, 6401 Security Blvd., Baltimore, MD 21235-6401. <b>Send only comments relating
            to our time estimate to this address, not the completed form.</b></p>
