<p style="border:5px solid tomato; color: #002A5C;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You MUST provide a properly completed application and the required evidence before we
    can process your application. We can only accept original documents or documents certified by the
    custodian of the original record. Notarized copies or photocopies which have not been certified by the
    custodian of the record are not acceptable. We will return any documents submitted with your application.
    For assistance call us at 1-800-772-1213 or visit our website at  <b style="color: #002A5C"><a href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov">www.socialsecurity.gov</a></b>.</p>

    <!--Original Social Security Card -->
<h2 style=" color: #002A5C;">Original Social Security Card</h2>
<p style=" color: #002A5C;">To apply for an original card, you must provide at least two documents to prove age, identity, and U.S.
    citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized immigration status. If you are not a U.S. citizen and do not
    have DHS work authorization, you must prove that you have a valid non-work reason for requesting a
    card. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>

<p style=" color: #002A5C;">NOTE: If you are age 12 or older and have never received a Social Security number, you must apply in
    person.</p>
    <!--Replacement Social Security Card -->
<h2 style=" color: #002A5C;">Replacement Social Security Card</h2>

<p style=" color: #002A5C;">To apply for a replacement card, you must provide one document to prove your identity. If you were born
    outside the U.S., you must also provide documents to prove your U.S. citizenship or current, lawful, work authorized status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>

<h2 style=" color: #002A5C;">Changing Information on Your Social Security Record</h2>
<p style=" color: #002A5C;">To change the information on your Social Security number record (i.e., a name or citizenship change, or
    corrected date of birth) you must provide documents to prove your identity, support the requested change,
    and establish the reason for the change. For example, you may provide a birth certificate to show your
    correct date of birth. A document supporting a name change must be recent and identify you by both your
    old and new names. If the name change event occurred over two years ago or if the name change
    document does not have enough information to prove your identity, you must also provide documents to
    prove your identity in your prior name and/or in some cases your new legal name. If you were born outside
    the U.S. you must provide a document to prove your U.S. citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized
    status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>

<center><h2 style=" color: tomato;"><u>LIMITS ON REPLACEMENT SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS</u></h2></center>
<p style=" color: #002A5C;">Public Law 108-458 limits the number of replacement Social Security cards you may receive to 3 per
    calendar year and 10 in a lifetime. Cards issued to reflect changes to your legal name or changes to a work
    authorization legend do not count toward these limits. We may also grant exceptions to these limits if you
    provide evidence from an official source to establish that a Social Security card is required.
</p>

<center><h2 style=" color: tomato;"><u>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS</u></h2></center>
