    <p style="border:5px solid tomato; color: #002A5C;"><b>GENERAL:</b> Items on the form are self-explanatory or are discussed below. The numbers match the
        numbered items on the form. If you are completing this form for someone else, please complete the
        items as they apply to that person.</p>

    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">4. Show the month, day, and full (4 digit) year of birth; for example, “1998” for year of birth.
    </p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">5. If you check “Legal Alien Not Allowed to Work” or “Other,” you must provide a document from a
        U.S. Federal, State, or local government agency that explains why you need a Social Security number
        and that you meet all the requirements for the government benefit. NOTE: Most agencies do not require
        that you have a Social Security number. Contact us to see if your reason qualifies for a Social Security
        number.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">6., 7. Providing race and ethnicity information is voluntary and is requested for informational and
        statistical purposes only. Your choice whether to answer or not does not affect decisions we make on
        your application. If you do provide this information, we will treat it very carefully.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">9.B., 10.B. If you are applying for an original Social Security card for a child under age 18, you MUST
        show the parents' Social Security numbers unless the parent was never assigned a Social Security
        number. If the number is not known and you cannot obtain it, check the “unknown” box.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">13. If the date of birth you show in item 4 is different from the date of birth currently shown on your
        Social Security record, show the date of birth currently shown on your record in item 13 and provide
        evidence to support the date of birth shown in item 4.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">16. Show an address where you can receive your card 7 to 14 days from now.</p>
    <p style=" color: #002A5C;">17. WHO CAN SIGN THE APPLICATION? If you are age 18 or older and are physically and mentally
        capable of reading and completing the application, you must sign in item 17. If you are under age 18,
        you may either sign yourself, or a parent or legal guardian may sign for you. If you are over age 18 and
        cannot sign on your own behalf, a legal guardian, parent, or close relative may generally sign for you. If
        you cannot sign your name, you should sign with an "X” mark and have two people sign as witnesses in
        the space beside the mark. Please do not alter your signature by including additional information on the
        signature line as this may invalidate your application. Call us if you have questions about who may sign
        your application.</p>
